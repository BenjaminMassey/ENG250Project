## Basic Overview

This is a web based game made for my ENG 250 class my second term freshman year at the University of Oregon.

It's a very openended project that is supposed to look at the themes we looked at in texts such as Fun Home and Glass Castle.

I decided to make a game - mainly because I had been thinking of trying some web game development.

The theme I'm looking at is the idea of home - a common topic in class.

The idea for the project is a game with two versions with two different homes. One will have a lot of elements that we've identified as important: relationships (NPCs), objects (background stuff), etc. The other version will be more barren.

Then, we will track each player's time spent in the in-game home, and compare the difference of that time between the two home versions.

I don't know if it will reveal much, but it should be fun.

## Code Side

This will be written using https://www.pixijs.io/ - so Javascript.

I am learning PixiJS and web game development in general with this project, so bare with me.

## How to run

When I'm done, I'm planning on hosting at https://eng250.benjaminmassey.com/

However, I doubt I'll be running it all the time so you might not be able to catch it there.

So run it yourself!

PixiJS is pretty simple to run.

If you're on windows, just run the server.exe included - it's the very basic Mongoose server https://cesanta.com/

Otherwise, just find some way to run an http server. I'll let you figure it out on your own - plenty of stuff out there

## Most Importantly

Have fun!
